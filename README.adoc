Zuul OAAS is a _standalone_ Authorization Server for OAuth 2.0 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[RFC 6749]).
The “standalone” means that it’s decoupled from resource provider(s), i.e. you can have many resource providers and just one authorization server that issues and validates tokens.
It provides RESTful API for clients and resources management.

Zuul OAAS is build on top of http://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth[Spring Security OAuth] and written in Groovy.
